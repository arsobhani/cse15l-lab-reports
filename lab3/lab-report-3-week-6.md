The header takes you to the index page, but here is a separate link for [index](index.html).

In order to access the .ssh folder, I had to do `Command + Shift + .(period)`. This is for Mac.
This brings up the private files and folders in addition to the public ones. Then I added the respective text for the *ssh* alias in **config**.
